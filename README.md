# d-gitea

This is the gitea docker container used to run gitea on charlesreid1.com.

You should not run this container by itself (see 
[pod-charlesreid1](https://git.charlesreid1.com/docker/pod-charlesreid1.git)). 

## TODO

update with jinja templates

update location of app config

give instructions on how to apply default values to template variables w/o ansible

how to turn on https (i.e., only git over ssh, doesn't work with self-signed cert)
